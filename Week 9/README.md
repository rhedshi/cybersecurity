# Project 9 - Honeypot

Time spent: **6** hours spent in total

> Objective: Setup a honeypot and intercept some attempted attacks in the wild.

## Summary

We used the well-supported open source honeypot [Modern Honey Network](https://github.com/threatstream/mhn) deployed through [Google Compute Platform](https://cloud.google.com/) as our setup. We created an `mhn-admin` and four other `mhn-honeypot` VM instances on [Google Compute Engine](https://cloud.google.com/compute/).

We deployed these four honeypots to each of the `mhn-honeypot` VMs:

1. `mhn-honeypot-1` - [Dionaea over HTTP](https://github.com/rep/dionaea)
2. `mhn-honeypot-2` - [Wordpot](https://github.com/threatstream/wordpot)
3. `mhn-honeypot-3` - [Elastichoney](https://github.com/threatstream/elastichoney)
4. `mhn-honeypot-4` - [Snort](https://github.com/threatstream/snort)

After about a week of data collection, there were **~40,000** attacks on the Dionaea over HTTP honeypot, **~2,000** attacks on the Snort honeypot, and **~10** attacks on the Elastichoney honeypot. There were **0** attacks on the Wordpot honeypot.

> NOTE: The Snort honeypot was started mid-week and had around half the time to collect data.

## Details

These were the specific VM instances deployed through Google Compute Engine along with their corresponding honeypots and attack counts.

## Problems

The Wordpot honeypot was the only one that didn't show any attacks, despite efforts of running `nmap` and `wpscan` against the honeypot.

[!] The WordPress URL supplied 'http://35.185.212.44/' seems to be down. Maybe the site is blocking wpscan so you can try the --random-agent parameter.

## Notes

The MHN honeypots were easy to set up. After starting the VM instances on Google Compute Engine, it was simply a matter of running the commands for each honeypot provided in the MHN admin console. Setting up Google Compute Engine was much more involved.
