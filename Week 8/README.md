# Project 8 - Pentesting Live Targets

Time spent: **8** hours spent in total

> Objective: Identify vulnerabilities in three different versions of the Globitek website: blue, green, and red.

The six possible exploits are:
* Username Enumeration
* Insecure Direct Object Reference (IDOR)
* SQL Injection (SQLi)
* Cross-Site Scripting (XSS)
* Cross-Site Request Forgery (CSRF)
* Session Hijacking/Fixation

Each version of the site has been given two of the six vulnerabilities. (In other words, all six of the exploits should be assignable to one of the sites.)

## Blue

## Bonus

> Bonus Objective 2: Build on Objective #4 (Cross-Site Scripting). Experiment to see if you can use XSS to: a) direct the user to a new URL, b) read cookie data, c) set cookie data.
